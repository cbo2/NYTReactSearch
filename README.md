# NYTReactSearch
This application will allow users to search a term of their interest and ranging start/end year within the 
New York Times api.  Discovered articles mathing the criteria will be limited to 5 articles.  Each of the discovered
articles will be encapsulated in a custom react component.  These will then be presented to the user with the option of
persisting those articles to the Mongo DB.  Associated links to those articles will be encapsulated in the data.  
Each of saved artciles will be encapsulated in a custom react component (also with associated styling and button).  
Users may also choose to delete any previously saved articles.  Users may also choose to execute a new search at any time.
